Welcome to django-knowledge!
============================

django-knowledge makes it easy to add an integrated support desk, help desk or 
knowledge base to your Django project with only a few lines of boilerplate code.
While we give you a generic design for free, you should just as easily be able 
to customize the look and feel of the app if you like.

**django-knowledge** was developed internally for `Zapier <https://zapier.com/z/qO/>`_ 
(see it live here `on our support page <https://zapier.com/z/3C/support/>`_). Or, check 
out a `plain, live demo <http://django-knowledge.org/>`_.


At a glance:
------------

- Turn common questions or support requests into a **knowledge base**.
- Control **who sees what** with simple per object view permissions: *public* (everyone), 
  *private* (poster & staff), or *internal* (only staff).
- Assign questions and answers to **categories** for easy sorting.
- Staff get **moderation controls** or they can use the familiar *Django admin* to handle support requests.
- Allow **anonymous questions**, or require a standard Django user account (the default).
- Included base **templates and design** with prebundled HTML and CSS.
- Optionally **alert users** of new responses via email (or your own alert system).
- BSD license.
